 App to keep track of price matches from PriceSpy vs Our website.
 Basic Logic: 
 1. Take product links and store pricing from store page
 2. Combine these new prices with the old price file in JSON format, preserving dates where applicable
 3. Display these and allow for 'ignoring' of products.
==============================================================================

The priceSpyScraper.py script downloads the products from our shop page on Price spy in the following format:

		"product",
        "theirPrice",
        "ourPrice",
        "link",
        "ignoreStatus" (always 0 at this stage), 
        "productID",
        "dateScraped"

The data is then added to the 'prices.json' file that adds 

"dateScraped",
"dateIgnored"

This is then displayed via javascript on the page 'index.php'.

When ignored (or unignored), products are passed to 'writeIgnore.php'. This writes the 'ignoreStatus' variable to the 'prices.json' file.
